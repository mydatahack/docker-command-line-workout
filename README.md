### (1) INTERACTING WITH CONTAINER
---

<b>(1) Checking container stats</b>

Check which container is using how much CPU or Memory.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
docker stats displays a live stream of container resource usage statistics

```bash
docker stats
```
</details>

<b>(2) Streaming container log</b>

Stream container log in the terminal.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
-f will allow you to stream the log.

```bash
docker logs -f <Container Name>
```
</details>

<b>(3) Listing containers</b>

List 
- all the existing containers
- all the existing images
- all the running containers

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
docker container list --all

docker images 
# or docker image ls

docker ps
```
</details>

<b>(4) Getting into Docker's container shell</b>

Get into docker's container shell with interactive mode. Then exit.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
# -i: Interactive
# -t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY
docker exec -it <container-name> bash # this works most of the time

# some containers need to do it like this
docker exec -it <container-name>  /bin/sh  # e.g node alpine containers
docker exec -it <container-name>  /bin/bash

# then exit
exit

### (2) BUILDING CONTAINERS
---

<b>(1) Build and run from Dockerfile</b>

Build a container with container name called my-app from the Dockerfile below with port mapping of 3000 to 3000. Then, restart the container.

```dockerfile
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "/app/src/index.js"]
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-app .

# Start the container with port apping.
docker run -dp 3000:3000 my-app

# Stop the container
docker stop my-app

# Start the container
docker start my-app
```
</details>

<b>(2) Stop the container and remove</b>

Stop the exisiting container named my-app and remove it.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
# -f will stop and remove the container
docker rm <container-id or name> -f

# Alternatively stop and remove
docker stop <container-id or name>
docker rm <container-id or name>

### (3) DOCKER-COMPOSE
---

<b>(1) Starting all the existing containers</b>

Starting all the existing container created by docker-compose.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
docker-compose start
```

</details>

<b>(2) Stop all the existing containers</b>

Stopping all the existing container created by docker-compose.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

```bash
docker-compose stop `1234567890-\][poiuytrewq AZSXDFGHJKL;'
?   1234\
]
```
</details>

<b>(3) Rebuilding the containers</b>

After updating docker file or docker-compose file, rebuild the containers.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

This will update the container and restart the container. It will take up the terminal process. If you do ctrl + c, it will stop all the containers.
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Of course, we can run container in a detached mode. This will keep all the container running.
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
